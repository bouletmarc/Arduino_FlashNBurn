# Arduino Flash&Burn for Windows Users
The Arduino Flash&amp;Burn EPROM Programmer can Read/Write/Verify Chips such as 27C256, SST 27SF512, 29C256.
IT is 'electronics free', meaning you only need the Arduino, the chip, and a couple of wires to make that work.

# Which '.bin' Software can works with this ?
- Crome Tuning
- BRe
- eCtune
- NepTune 'HRTuning'
- TurboEdit
- TunerPro
- Anys others kind of Binary Editor (EEPROM)

# Requirements :
- Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10) 32bits & 64bits
- Arduino Mega 2560
- 28Pin DIP / EEPROM Chips
- Require Microsoft .net 3.5 installed (Most computer have it)

# Method 1 (Breadboard) :
Requirements :
- Breadboard
- 28x Male/Male Wires

Wiring Schema/Diagram between the Arduino and the Chip :

Pros :
- Very Cheap as it only need a breadboard and Wires

Cons :
- Take more time to wire with the Arduino
- Not easily transportable, wires can detach
- Take More Spaces


# Method 2 (PCB) :
Requirements :
- 28Pin DIP Socket
- 36Pin or 40Pin(Most communs) Male/Male Header (2x 18Pin or 2x 20Pin)
- PCB 'Test' Board
- Soldering Gun & Iron
- Soldering Knowledge.

Pros :
- Small and Portable design
- No Wires (Mine only as a 'pinout tester' wire/led added)
- Very fast to attach/detach with the Arduino

Cons :
- Little more costy ($)


# Arduino Flash&Burn (Windows GUI) Functions :
- Load File to Buffer
- Save Buffer to File
- Read Chip
- Program Chip
- Verify Chip
- Blank Check
- Erase Chip
- Edit Reading/Writing Chip addressing
- Edit Reading/Writing Buffer addressing
- Much Mores...

# Terms & Condition :
It is free to use and it will always stay FREE.
I include the sourc file for those who want to edit then and make there own projects out of it.
Anys kinds of credits and/or referal pages to my github would be very appreciated if you use this source for your own projects.

I can probably give support over EMAIL : Bouletmarc@hotmail.com
